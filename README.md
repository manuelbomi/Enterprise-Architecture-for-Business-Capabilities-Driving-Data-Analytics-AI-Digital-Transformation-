# Enterprise Architecture for Business Capabilities:<sub> Driving Data, Analytics, AI & Digital Transformation at Scale</sub>

#### -  *A practitioner-oriented guide to using Business Capability Modeling as the backbone for enterprise-wide Data, AI, ML, MLOps, and Digital Transformation architectures*
---

## Executive Summary

##### Modern enterprises are no longer constrained by technology availability—they are constrained by <ins>architectural alignment</ins>.

##### Data platforms, AI/ML systems, cloud infrastructure, and digital products often fail to deliver expected business outcomes not because of poor engineering, but because strategy, capabilities, and execution are misaligned.

##### This repository presents a <ins>capability-driven Enterprise Architecture (EA) approach</ins> that:

- Anchors business strategy to execution

- Scales data, analytics, AI, and ML systems responsibly

- Enables cross-domain alignment across business, product, data, and technology

- Supports continuous evolution, not static architectures

##### The approach integrates:

- Business Capability Modeling

- TOGAF / ArchiMate / Zachman viewpoints

- Data & AI architecture patterns

- MLOps and platform operating models

- Cloud, hybrid, and on-prem deployment realities
