# Enterprise Architecture for Business Capabilities:<sub> Driving Data, Analytics, AI & Digital Transformation at Scale</sub>

#### -  *A practitioner-oriented guide to using Business Capability Modeling as the backbone for enterprise-wide Data, AI, ML, MLOps, and Digital Transformation architectures*
---

## Executive Summary

##### Modern enterprises are no longer constrained by technology availability—they are constrained by <ins>architectural alignment</ins>.

##### Data platforms, AI/ML systems, cloud infrastructure, and digital products often fail to deliver expected business outcomes not because of poor engineering, but because strategy, capabilities, and execution are misaligned.

##### This repository presents a <ins>capability-driven Enterprise Architecture (EA) approach</ins> that:

- Anchors business strategy to execution

- Scales data, analytics, AI, and ML systems responsibly

- Enables cross-domain alignment across business, product, data, and technology

- Supports continuous evolution, not static architectures

##### The approach integrates:

- Business Capability Modeling

- TOGAF / ArchiMate / Zachman viewpoints

- Data & AI architecture patterns

- MLOps and platform operating models

- Cloud, hybrid, and on-prem deployment realities

---

## Why Business Capability Modeling Is Foundational to EA
##### What Is a Business Capability?

##### A business capability describes what an organization is able to do, independent of:

- Organizational structure

- People

- Processes

- Technologies

##### Capabilities are:

- Stable over time

- Strategy-aligned

- Ideal anchors for architectural decisions

##### Capabilities answer *“What must the enterprise be good at?”—not “How do we do it today?”*

---

## Business Capability Models as the Bridge Between Strategy & IT

##### One of the hardest EA challenges is translating strategy into executable architecture.

##### Business Capability Models (BCMs) solve this by acting as:

- A common language between business and technology

- A decision framework for investment, modernization, and divestment

- A guiding star for data, AI, and platform architectures

### Strategic Outcomes Enabled by BCMs

- Clear prioritization of AI and data initiatives

- Transparent trade-offs between speed, cost, risk, and value

- Alignment of enterprise platforms to real business outcomes

- Reduced architectural entropy and duplication

        v (realized by)
[Business Capabilities]

        v (served by)
[Application & Technology Services]

        v (used by)
[Products, Solutions & Delivery Teams]

```

```python
flowchart TB
    Strategy["Enterprise Strategy & OKRs"]
    Capabilities["Business Capability Model"]
    Domains["Domain & Value Streams"]
    Architecture["Target State Architectures"]
    Platforms["Data / AI / Digital Platforms"]
    Execution["Products, Solutions & Delivery"]

    Strategy --> Capabilities
    Capabilities --> Domains
    Domains --> Architecture
    Architecture --> Platforms
    Platforms --> Execution

## Mapping Capability-Driven Enterprise Architecture to TOGAF ADM

#### Capabilities bridge strategy and execution across all ADM phases.

| From Archimate flowchart to Business Concept | TOGAF ADM Phase |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Strategy & OKRs | Preliminary / Phase A |
| Capability Model | Phase B (Business Architecture) |
| Domains & Value Streams | Phase B |
| Target Architectures | Phases B, C, D |
| Platforms (Data / AI) | Phase C & D |
| Products & Delivery | Phases E–G |

## TOGAF ADM Phase Mapping

| Archimate/Business Concept | TOGAF ADM Phase | Description |
|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Strategy & OKRs** | **Preliminary / Phase A** | Architecture vision, business principles, and strategic objectives |
| **Capability Model** | **Phase B (Business Architecture)** | Business capabilities, organizational structure, and processes |
| **Domains & Value Streams** | **Phase B** | Value streams, business functions, and domain decomposition |
| **Target Architectures** | **Phases B, C, D** | Business, data, application, and technology architecture definitions |
| **Platforms (Data / AI)** | **Phase C & D** | Data architecture, AI platforms, and technology infrastructure |
| **Products & Delivery** | **Phases E–G** | Implementation planning, migration, and governance |
