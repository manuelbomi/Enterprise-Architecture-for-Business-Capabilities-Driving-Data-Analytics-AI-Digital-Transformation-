# Enterprise Architecture for Business Capabilities:<sub> Driving Data, Analytics, AI & Digital Transformation at Scale</sub>

#### -  *A practitioner-oriented guide to using Business Capability Modeling as the backbone for enterprise-wide Data, AI, ML, MLOps, and Digital Transformation architectures*
---

## Executive Summary

##### Modern enterprises are no longer constrained by technology availability—they are constrained by <ins>architectural alignment</ins>.

##### Data platforms, AI/ML systems, cloud infrastructure, and digital products often fail to deliver expected business outcomes not because of poor engineering, but because strategy, capabilities, and execution are misaligned.

##### This repository presents a <ins>capability-driven Enterprise Architecture (EA) approach</ins> that:

- Anchors business strategy to execution

- Scales data, analytics, AI, and ML systems responsibly

- Enables cross-domain alignment across business, product, data, and technology

- Supports continuous evolution, not static architectures

##### The approach integrates:

- Business Capability Modeling

- TOGAF / ArchiMate / Zachman viewpoints

- Data & AI architecture patterns

- MLOps and platform operating models

- Cloud, hybrid, and on-prem deployment realities

## Why Business Capability Modeling Is Foundational to EA
##### What Is a Business Capability?

##### A business capability describes what an organization is able to do, independent of:

- Organizational structure

- People

- Processes

- Technologies

##### Capabilities are:

- Stable over time

- Strategy-aligned

- Ideal anchors for architectural decisions

##### Capabilities answer *“What must the enterprise be good at?”—not “How do we do it today?”*

## Business Capability Models as the Bridge Between Strategy & IT

##### One of the hardest EA challenges is translating strategy into executable architecture.

##### Business Capability Models (BCMs) solve this by acting as:

- A common language between business and technology

- A decision framework for investment, modernization, and divestment

- A guiding star for data, AI, and platform architectures

### Strategic Outcomes Enabled by BCMs

- Clear prioritization of AI and data initiatives

- Transparent trade-offs between speed, cost, risk, and value

- Alignment of enterprise platforms to real business outcomes

- Reduced architectural entropy and duplication
